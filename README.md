## Project Title: FastAPI Cluster with Selenium, PostgreSQL, and Terraform

### Overview
This repository demonstrates the deployment of a highly scalable and automated FastAPI application within a Kubernetes cluster, orchestrated through Helm. The application integrates Selenium for automated web scraping tasks and leverages PostgreSQL as its primary data storage. Infrastructure provisioning is streamlined using Terraform, which establishes a dedicated PostgreSQL server to ensure a robust backend.

### Key Components

- **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ utilizing standard Python type hints.
  
- **Selenium**: Integrated for web scraping, Selenium automates the browsing of web pages and extraction of necessary data, making it ideal for dynamic data collection tasks.

- **PostgreSQL**: Serving as the application’s primary database, PostgreSQL is used to store and manage the data extracted via Selenium. The PostgreSQL server is provisioned using Terraform scripts, ensuring consistent and reliable database infrastructure.

- **Kubernetes with Helm**: The application is containerized using Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. Helm charts are employed to manage the deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management of the application, facilitating seamless updates and rollbacks.

- **CronJob**: A Kubernetes CronJob is configured to run the Selenium web scraper daily, automating the data collection process and ensuring the database is regularly updated with the latest data.

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is implemented with Terraform to automate the provisioning of the PostgreSQL server on a cloud platform, enabling a repeatable and consistent infrastructure setup across different environments.

### Features

- **Scalable Deployment**: Kubernetes ensures the application can scale horizontally to meet varying demand, with replicas managed efficiently through Helm charts.

- **Automated Web Scraping**: Selenium integration allows for automated, scheduled data scraping, ensuring that the application maintains up-to-date information with minimal manual intervention.

- **Secure Secret Management**: Sensitive information, such as database credentials, is securely managed using Kubernetes secrets, providing a robust security model for the application.

- **Infrastructure Automation**: Terraform scripts automate the provisioning of the PostgreSQL server, enabling a repeatable and reliable infrastructure setup that can be easily managed and scaled.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local development environment.

2. **Configure Secrets**: Set up the necessary Kubernetes secrets to securely manage database credentials and other sensitive information.

3. **Deploy with Helm**: Utilize the provided Helm charts to deploy the FastAPI application, along with its associated components, to your Kubernetes cluster.

4. **Run Terraform**: Execute the Terraform scripts to provision the PostgreSQL server on your chosen cloud provider, ensuring a reliable and consistent database environment.

5. **Monitor and Scale**: Use Kubernetes tools to monitor the application’s performance, and scale the deployment as needed based on traffic and usage metrics.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed to facilitate container building and management.
- **Kubernetes**: A fully operational Kubernetes cluster is required for deploying the application.
- **Helm**: Helm must be installed to manage the deployment of Kubernetes resources.
- **Terraform**: Terraform CLI is needed for provisioning cloud infrastructure components like the PostgreSQL server.

### Conclusion

This project exemplifies a full-stack deployment of a modern web application, utilizing best practices in infrastructure automation, containerization, and Kubernetes orchestration. It serves as a reference architecture for building scalable, automated, and secure Python-based applications, demonstrating the seamless integration of FastAPI, Selenium, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform.
