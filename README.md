## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Docker and Docker Compose.
- You have installed `kubectl` if you plan to deploy on Kubernetes.
- You have access to a Kubernetes cluster (if deploying on Kubernetes).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Set up the environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

## Running the Project

1. **Build and run the Docker containers:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. **Access the application:**

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Verify PostgreSQL is running:**

    PostgreSQL should be running on port `5432`. You can use tools like `pgAdmin` or `psql` to connect to the database.

## Deploying on Kubernetes

1. **Update the `deployment.yaml` file:**

    Replace `<your-docker-image>` with your Docker image name and version.

2. **Deploy the application:**

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

3. **Check the deployment status:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get services
    ```

    Ensure the application is running correctly.

## Project Structure

Here’s an overview of the project structure:

```

│   └── test_main.py      # Unit tests for the FastAPI application
├── Dockerfile            # Dockerfile for building the FastAPI container
├── docker-compose.yml    # Docker Compose configuration
└── deployment.yaml       # Kubernetes deployment configuration
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

1. **Run tests with pytest:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec fastapi pytest
    ```

2. **Check test coverage (if configured):**

### Step 3: Add the File to GitHub

1. **Add the file to Git tracking:**

    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```

2. **Create a commit with the changes:**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add documentation to README.md"
    ```

3. **Push the file to the GitHub repository:**

    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```

### Step 4: Verify the Documentation on GitHub

After pushing the file, you can visit your repository on GitHub and see the `README.md` on the main page.

### Summary

- **Created the `README.md` file**: This file provides documentation and is displayed on the main page of your repository.
- **Wrote full documentation** explaining your project, how to run it, how to deploy it on Kubernetes, and what the project structure is.
- **Pushed the file to GitHub** so that anyone visiting the repository can read and understand your project.

If you have any more questions or want to add additional sections to the documentation, feel free to ask!
